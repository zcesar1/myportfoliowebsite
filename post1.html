			<h1>Is Google Assistant an Intelligent Agent?</h1>
			<p>I investigated if Google Assistant was an intelligent. I first asked my Assistant if 10 questions to test its intelligence. Afterwards, I recorded my initial reactions and then re-did the experiment, filming the interaction. I will say, the assistant responed differently to some of the questions the second time around. I will post post my first Q&amp;A for comparison. </p>
			
			<h4>The questions I asked:</h4>
			<ol type="1">
				<li> How's it going?</li>
				<li> How old are you?</li>
				<li> Can you set a 10s timer?</li>
				<li> What is the weather?</li>
				<li> Is it humid outside?</li>
				<li> Are you intelligent?</li>
				<li> What is a Kalman Filter?</li>
				<li> What is harmony?</li>
				<li> What is life?</li>
				<li> Do you like to play games?</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>My Initial Reactions</h3>
			<p>When I first asked my Assistant questions I was surprised by the way it answered. I didn't even know that Google could respond to questions without being literal! For example, for the first question, I felt like the response was sweet. Then, for the second question, I was surprised that it didn't say something like, "I am 10 years old," or something like that. I got am explanation about when it was launched and I felt like the answer was funny.</p>

			<p>Other things I found interesting about my Google Assistant was that if I asked it something like the weather, it would pull up the forecast, but then include a text message of some sort, like "don't forget an umbrella." I felt like that was clever.</p>

			<img src="images/Screenshot_20170905-193051.png" style="width: 70%" />
			<p>I think my favorite response was when I asked my Assistant if she was intelligent. I felt like her answer was a bit sassy, but truthful. She knew that she was smarter than a common object, but didn't realize her potential.</p>

			<h3>Is it an Intelligent Agent?</h3>
			<p>So, after a lot of reading, I've come to the conclusion that Google Assistant is a Model-based reflex agent. I'll explain using the characteristics that make up an intelligent agent:
			<ul>
				<li>P: We want a response from the agent that answers our questions</li>
				<li>E: The Internet</li>
				<li>A: URLs</li>
				<li>S: Connection to the Internet</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			The Google Assistant has all the characteristics of an Intelligent Agent, so it is one.
